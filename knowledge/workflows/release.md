# Steps

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and any user-facing docs affected by the change.
2. Run the full verification from [testing](../testing/verification.md).
3. Build the frontend with `bash scripts/web-build.sh`.
4. Let CI build the backend, Windows compile target, frontend checks, proto
   lint and images.
5. Tag only after CI is green. Do not merge or deploy from an agent session;
   that is the supervisor's decision.

# Rules

- A release note must describe shipped behavior, not planned behavior.
- Do not publish an image that was built from a dirty or unverified tree.
- If a check cannot run, say so; do not describe it as passed.
- Changes to module image inputs also run the build-only `build-inputs.yml`
  workflow for Geyser and status on Linux amd64/arm64. PR checks do not log in
  to a registry or publish images; module-tag publication remains separate.
